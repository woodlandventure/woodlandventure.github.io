                            Do you have an outdoor space that needs a bit of love?
                            Perhaps you have a garden that you don't use.
                            If you're a teacher, perhaps it's a school playground that the children don't use.
                            Or maybe an overgrown woodland area in your school grounds. <br> <br>

                            Woodland Venture can help with that! <br>

                            We create bespoke outdoor spaces which people love to spend time in.
                            Reclaim your garden with outdoor seating under a sheltered pergola.
                            Or create a space for children to play and learn in with sheltered
                            tent areas, outdoor stages, compost toilets and more. <br> <br>
