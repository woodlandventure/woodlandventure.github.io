                            If your special person has a love for adventure and the outdoors, what better way for them to
                            celebrate their special day than with a celebration in the woods (suitable for ages 5-100).<br><br>
                            We can accommodate parties for up to 32 children in an environment where they can build,
                            create, play and explore nature with their friends.<br><br>
                            We have lots of options available to make your party special and
                            appropriate for the age of your special person.<br><br>
                            We can feed them with food cooked over an open fire and keep them refreshed
                            with hot chocolate and marshmallows.<br><br>
